# Severance Time

A homage to Apple TV's "Severance" series, recreating the iconic number selection and binning animation sequence from the show.

## About This Project

This project was built as a creative experiment using:
- Angular 19
- GSAP for smooth animations
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Cursor AI

I'm a huge fan of the show and wanted to recreate one of its most distinctive visual elements - the mysterious number grid and time management system from Lumon Industries.

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
ng serve

# Build for production
ng build
```

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the creators of "Severance" for the incredible artistic inspiration.

Built with ❤️ using Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Cursor.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
